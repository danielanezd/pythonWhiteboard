# pythonWhiteboard

#### This is a sample project of a Python interpreter in real time.

##### The goal for this project is to create a software in which you can test simple code or use it as a notepad for "dummy" code that you just want to test before upload it to your own repo. Similar to creating a python script but without actually creating it and then running the script on the terminal.

##### Yes, I know that you're thinking "but you can do that by running Python on cmd or any other terminal", and the answer is: Yes... but I'm still doing this little project.

#### For this project I'm using Python 3.10 and I'll list all the dependencies and a step by step about how to use it once I have a beta version.

###### Thanks for taking you time and read this file.
